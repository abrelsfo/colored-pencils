> Interactive color palette for quick color picking

I created this because I wanted a color palette that combined all my favorite features from w3schools color picker and thomaslindstroms color-picker Atom module. I used jscolor for the mini color picker and to change the text color.

## Features

* On the rgb tab if you click the boxes at the bottom with the color values then it will copy that value into your clipboard.

* On the Hue, Saturation, and Value tabs you can click the colors and all the values on the rgb tab will update.
